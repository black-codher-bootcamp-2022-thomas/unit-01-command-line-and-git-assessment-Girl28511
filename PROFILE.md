## **BIO** 
I have worked in digital marketing for the last 6 years but now am learning to how to code in hopes of becoming a software engineer! 
## **EDUCATION**

## **INTERESTS** 
I am an avid foodie *which now also includes ***me*** cooking* I am always looking for the best new places to dine and try new cuisines. I also enjoy being outdoors whether that is running during the week or climbing different mountains around the UK.

When I am looking for places to explore I usually like to check some of my favourite bloggers/websites: 
- [Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/uk-best-hiking-trails)
- [Conde Nast traveller](https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/most-beautiful-restaurants-england)
- [Meat One Veg](https://meatandoneveg.blog)

I also love watching films, I took an interest a few years ago when I realised I was a huge fan of directors such as Gaspar Noe, Yorgos Lanthimos and Wes Anderson. My favourite films of all time are; 
1. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
2. Dune
3. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes
4. Blade Runner
5. Breakfast at Tiffany's 

During this bootcamp I would love to be competent in the following; 
- [ ] HTML/CSS
- [ ] JavaScript
